# Data
Since this code generates a random set of data we have uploaded the data we are using at this time it can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/tkpq6wjkumun0ku0yzdk3/h?dl=0&rlkey=kh3cd1ukyo8khpctx2nkhj1d8">here</a>. For training either generate a npy file using Dataset Generation.ipynb or download and place our file in the same folder.

# Code
The code can be found in two notebooks, Dataset Generation.ipynb includes the code for dataset generation and Training.ipynb has the model training and evaluation.
